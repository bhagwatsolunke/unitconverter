Unit Converter
This is a simple web-based unit converter built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to convert between different units of length, including meters, kilometers, miles, and yards.

Getting Started
To use this unit converter, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. You can then enter a value and select a unit to convert from, and select a unit to convert to. Press the "Convert" button to perform the conversion and see the result.

How It Works
The unit converter is implemented using JavaScript. When the user clicks the "Convert" button, the convert() function is called. This function reads the input value and unit from the "From" fields, and the desired unit from the "To" fields. It then uses a series of switch statements to convert the value from the input unit to the desired output unit, and displays the result in the "Result" field.

The conversion formulas are as follows:

1 meter = 0.001 kilometers
1 meter = 0.000621371 miles
1 meter = 1.09361 yards
1 kilometer = 1000 meters
1 kilometer = 0.621371 miles
1 kilometer = 1093.61 yards
1 mile = 1609.34 meters
1 mile = 1.60934 kilometers
1 mile = 1760 yards
1 yard = 0.9144 meters
1 yard = 0.0009144 kilometers
1 yard = 0.000568182 miles
Customization
You can customize the available units and conversion formulas by modifying the convert() function in the JavaScript code. You can also modify the HTML and CSS to change the layout and appearance of the unit converter.
